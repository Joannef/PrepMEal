# PrepMEal

iOS Development Project

The vision of this project was to create an ios app that helps set daily meal plans or meal preps weekly for people. 
The main feature of the app is that recipes are searchable from a recipe api called spoonacular and users can add the recipes to their weekly list of recipes.
Along with the recipes, people are also able to create a grocery list so that they can do grocery shopping for the week, making trips to the grocery store more efficient.
